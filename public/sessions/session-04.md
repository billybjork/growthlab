As designers/creatives, we're used to receiving feedback and notes from others.

But often, **the most useful critique comes from yourself** – your *other* self.

A habit of healthy self-critique is not only key to improving your own craft; it also equips you to be **much more effective in working with AI models!**</div>

<div class="callout">### 💭 **Open Question for the Group:**

**What are characteristics of useful or effective feedback/notes?**</div>

<details>
<summary>💡 Qualities of Effective Feedback:</summary>

- **🎯 Specific** – or even better: *properly calibrated specificity* (how open-ended should it be?)
  - Note: Open-ended feedback can still be effective if it focuses on **observations**, then allows the recipient to decide how to interpret
     - *Example: "I found myself lost in this section. I wonder if we can improve by…"*
  - **Invite conversation** rather than imposing changes


- **➡️ Actionable** – provides direction or a framework for improvement


- **⏰ Timely** – delivered when it's most useful (early enough to influence the work, not after decisions are locked)


- **🖼️ Uses examples** – images, links, other references


- **🎯 Grounded in goals** – based on specific reasons, goals, or principles—not opinions or vibes (remove ego from the equation)

***
#### 🎉 Surprise!
ALL of these are characteristics of effective AI prompts!

Effective AI prompts and creative feedback share the same qualities:
- ✅ Specificity calibration
- ✅ Actionable direction
- ✅ Uses examples/references
- ✅ Grounded in goals

</details>

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
#### Additionally, feedback should be grounded in our **<u>design criteria</u>**:
(used to evaluate the capstone projects)
<!-- col -->
<details>
<summary>📋 Design Criteria</summary>

- **Composition & Visual Hierarchy** - Visual elements are arranged to guide attention naturally to the most important areas, creating clarity without clutter.
- **Product Expression** - The product is presented in its best light, with design decisions that highlight features, benefits, and desirability.
- **Brand Consistency** - Colors, fonts, logos, and overall style align seamlessly with brand guidelines while reinforcing recognition.
- **Typography & Legibility** - Type choices are consistent, accessible, and easy to read across sizes, devices, and placements.

<summary>💡 Tips for Receiving Feedback:</summary>

- **🤫 Listen fully before responding** – focus on understanding, not defending

- **❓ Ask clarifying questions** – gently dig deeper on ambiguities

- **🔍 Look for the underlying need** – not just the suggested fix

- **🧘 Separate yourself from the work** – don't take it personally; keep emotional responses from blocking valuable insights

- **⏳ Give yourself time to process** – think through the feedback offered (though there won't be time in today's live session)!

## 👥 Breakout Rooms: Present Assignment #3

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<div class="callout">### **⚙️ Setup:**
- We will break into **4-5 small groups**
- Each attendee gets ~5 minutes** (including time for feedback) to share:
   - 🎬 1. Your **finished "production" asset**, created in Flora (Assignment #3)
   - 🔍 2. The **original reference** you found for BarkBox (Assignment #1), and why you think it's relevant/applicable
   - 🔄 3. Your **"rapid prototype"** based on that reference (Assignment #2)
   - 🌐 4. Your **Flora canvas** used to produce this asset

📝 <u>**Expectations**</u>: The group is expected to share **at least one piece of feedback** on the work shared by each attendee.</div>
<!-- col -->
<img src="media/session-04/20251202_122024.webp" alt="" style="display: block; max-width: 438px; width: 438px;; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

## 📢 Breakout Rooms: Reconvene

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### 💭 **Check-in Discussion:**

- Any specific feedback that you found **very helpful**?
- What made it helpful for you?
- How would you take the work further based on that feedback?</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **💡 Key Insight:**

As you may have found in the breakout room, a big part of the challenge in giving useful feedback is having the **vocabulary to articulate your intent and observations**.

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">Similarly, **vocabulary and wording is also key to AI prompting!**

So with that in mind, the rest of this session will focus on **"magic words"** for feedback and AI prompts!</div>
---
## 🪄 Activity: Magic Words

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">In this quick activity, we'll explore the difficulty in articulating imprecise/ambiguous wording.</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🌱 Part One:**

1. Billy cycles through **3-5 AI-generated images**
2. For each image, the group shares **example words they would have used** to prompt the image
3. Billy reveals the **actual prompts** used to generate the images

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🪜 Part Two:**

1. Billy cycles through the **same 3-5 AI-generated images** – this time paired with a **minimal critique fragment**: *"Make it more ____"*

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **💭 Possible "Magic Words":**

Punchy • Dynamic • Elevated • Beef Up • Moody • Tighten • Land • Zhush</div>

<!-- block -->

2. For each image, a **volunteer from the group** shares how they would interpret/apply the feedback (i.e., what they would change)

3. Billy reveals the **AI-modified version** of the asset, based on the minimal critique fragments

4. With input from the group, Billy **re-writes the feedback** to be more precise (applying previously discussed qualities of effective feedback) to re-generate the image

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **💡 The Goal:**

Reveal the impact of **more effective feedback** for refining AI outputs!</div>

## 📖 Magic Words – Cheat Sheet

<!-- block -->

### **This practice of crafting and refining instructions to guide AI models is commonly known as "prompt engineering"**

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### ⚠️ **Important Notes:**

- This is an **ever-changing field** with no ironclad rules or "silver bullet" fixes
- It's much more **intuitive** – you build experience by trying things, then paying attention to how your inputs shape/change the outputs</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **💡 Key Insight:**

Effective collaboration with AIs (and humans) begins with having a **sufficiently expansive creative vocabulary** to describe your intent.

## 🤖 Quick Note on "System Prompts"

<!-- block -->

### **Your prompt isn't the only prompt guiding outputs from the AI**

All AI models we use (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) have **"system prompts"**, which are crafted by the developing team (OpenAI, Google) and prepended to every chat you begin with the model.

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<img src="media/session-04/20251202_113905.webp" alt="" style="display: block; max-width: 548px; width: 548px;;; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
<!-- col -->
<div class="callout">### **What is a "System Prompt"?**

A set of instructions that tells an AI model:
- 🎭 **How to behave**
- 🎯 **What its role is**
- 📋 **What rules to follow**</div>

## 📋 Assignment #4: Reading System Prompts

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **💡 Why This Matters:**

Reading system prompts is a great way to understand the **inner workings of AIs / LLMs**.</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **📋 Steps:**

1. Choose **one of the system prompts** available in this repository:
   👉 **[Leaked System Prompts Collection](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts)**

2. **Read through the entire prompt**, and make note of anything you find interesting or unexpected

3. **Be prepared to share** at least one observation in the next session (next week)

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### ⚠️ **Note: No session tomorrow**

Instead, you can spend the time working on **Assignment #5** (crafting a "system prompt" for yourself, based on Brand B).

👉 **Take your time and do your best work.**</div>
