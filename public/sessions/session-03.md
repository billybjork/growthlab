## ⏪ Session #2 Recap

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **Quick refresher on key concepts:**

- **🚢 Ship of Theseus** – AI tools are inherently transformative, like "remix" machines
- **🎨 Generative ≠ from scratch** – Often the most effective AI use cases begin with an existing, non-AI-generated asset
- **⚡ Rapid prototyping** – Quickly validate ideas, accelerate collaboration
- **🔍 Creative references** – Foundational to the rapid prototyping process
- **🖼️ Image editing tools** (like Gemini) – Make it easy to rapidly prototype based on a creative reference</div>

## 🔄 Rapid Prototyping: Revisited

### **What's the benefit of rapid prototyping as a designer?**

Traditional workflows are risky: notes/feedback arrive <u>after</u> you've already sunk hours into a draft.
<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **⚡ Advantages of Rapid Prototyping:**

- ✅ **Validate ideas early** – Test a creative direction <u>before</u> investing further time/resources (eliminate potential wasted work)
- 🤝 **Accelerate collaboration** – Provide a concrete reference ("pre-viz") to discuss and quickly align with clients
- 🔀 **Explore variations** – Even better: provide multiple options so collaborators can compare before proceeding</div>

### **The Rise of Node-Based Workflows**

Node-based approaches align naturally with the transformative nature of AI technology.

<!-- row -->
<div class="callout">#### **🔗 Chain Bite-Sized Tasks**
Build up to final assets by connecting small, focused operations together.</div>
<!-- col -->
<div class="callout">#### **🔬 Compare & Test**
Easily test many model/prompt combinations to see which you like best, then narrow down from there.</div>

## 🎯 Task Chaining Activity: Part One

### **Understanding single-node limitations**

<!-- block -->

<details>
<summary>Pre-Work Reminder</summary>

Make sure you've completed Assignment #2 before this activity. We'll be building on those skills!

</details>

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **Setup:**
- We will break into small groups
- Each group receives a **video asset to replicate**
- Goal: Understand what multi-step workflows look like in their <u>absence</u></div>

<!-- block -->

***
### **📋 Steps (5-8 min):**

1. Each group receives a video asset to replicate
2. Open [Flora](https://flora.video/) and create a new Project
3. Group members brainstorm how to best replicate that asset using a **single node**
4. ⚠️ **Text prompt only** – do not attach any images/references this round

<!-- block -->

## 🎯 Task Chaining Activity: Part Two

### **Unlocking multi-step workflows**

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<div class="callout">### **💭 Reflection:**

Find it difficult to generate something usable with just a single text prompt?

**Probably…** that's to be expected!

Tools like Flora exist to maximize the possibilities with multi-step "task chains" – let's take advantage of those capabilities!</div>
<!-- col -->
[Image: Simple vs multi-node workflow comparison]
<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

***
### **📋 Steps (10 min):**

1. Return to your breakout group
2. Get another attempt to replicate the **same original asset** from Part One
3. Collaborate to construct a workflow involving **at least 3 nodes**
   - Example chain: text → image → edited image → end frame → video

<!-- block -->

## 🎯 Task Chaining Activity: Part Three

### **🎉 Surprise reveal!**

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">Each of the exemplar assets we've been trying to replicate originated from a workflow created by the **Flora Community**, such as:

- [Ad Agent](https://flora.video/)
- [Cosmetics Product Photography](https://flora.video/)
- [Lookbook Generator](https://flora.video/)
- [Branded Icon Generator](https://flora.video/)</div>

<!-- block -->

***
### **📋 Steps:**

1. Billy shares links to the specific workflows that produced the assets you've been replicating
2. Return to breakout rooms
3. Open the link to the workflow that produced your group's original asset
4. As a group, examine the different nodes – **make note of anything interesting or unexpected**
5. Group elects a representative to share learnings from Parts 1-3

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **Representative from each group (~5 min each):**

1. 🎬 The **original asset** the group attempted to replicate
2. 1️⃣ The group's output from **Part One** (one-shot / single node attempt)
3. 🔗 The group's output from **Part Two** (multi-step / multi-node attempt)
4. 🔍 The group's findings from **Part Three** (how the original was created in Flora)</div>

## 📋 Assignment #3: Mini Capstone

### **Sharpen your skills in Flora**

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **🎯 Goal:**

Create the **"production" version** of an asset you prototyped in Assignment #2 (based on a creative reference for BarkBox).

Option to use starting image(s) from **[provided source media folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_LINK)**</div>

<!-- block -->

***
### **📋 Steps:**

1. **Choose** one of your outputs from Assignment #2
2. **Outline** the "task chain" you envision using to create the "production" version
3. **Spend >60 min** building and experimenting in Flora
4. **Create at least >5 variations** (using different model/prompt combinations)

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **📊 Design Criteria:**

Consider how you can improve on the prototype:
- Does it feel "on brand" for BarkBox?
- Is it visually polished and production-ready?
- Does it effectively communicate the intended message?</div>

<!-- block -->

***
### **🎤 In the next session, come prepared to share:**

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<div class="callout">1. 🔍 The **original reference** you found for BarkBox (Assignment #1), and why you think it's relevant/applicable
2. 🚢 Your **"rapid prototype"** based on that reference (Assignment #2)
3. 🎬 Your **"production" version** of the asset, created in Flora (Assignment #3)
4. 🖥️ Your **Flora canvas** used to produce this asset</div>
