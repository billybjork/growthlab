<!-- block -->

### **📋 Objectives:**

- 🔍 Distill key insights from BetterHelp's internal docs for creative decision-making
- 🌐 Research the market and audience to understand real behaviors, needs, and positioning
- 🧠 Synthesize findings into a clear BetterHelp system prompt for consistent, brand-aligned creative and AI work
- 📄 Produce a portable "system prompt" document to be used for the rest of the course

<!-- block -->

<details>
<summary>📚 Pre-Work (required before starting)</summary>

Complete **[Assignment #4](session.html?file=session-04&card=assignment-4-reading-system-prompts)** from Session #4:
- Read through one of the [Leaked System Prompts](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts) and note what you found interesting or unexpected.
- This will help you understand what makes an effective system prompt before you build your own!

## 🎯 What You're Making

<!-- block -->

For the rest of the course, we'll focus on **BetterHelp** (not BarkBox).

In this session, you'll build a **BetterHelp System Prompt**: a compact reference you and your AI tools can reuse for any creative task in your capstone.

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<div class="callout">### **Your system prompt will capture:**

- 🏢 What BetterHelp is and how it works
- 👥 Who it's for and the world it lives in
- 🎨 How to create on-brand work that actually moves the business</div>
<!-- col -->

<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🛠️ How You'll Get There:**

You'll turn scattered information into one clear text file through **two main parts**:

1. **📂 Review internal docs** – Scan company materials and pull out what matters for creative work
2. **🌐 Research the real world** – Do focused external research (web, communities, reviews) to connect the brand to reality

Then you'll **assemble your BetterHelp System Prompt** from those insights.

### **File specifications:**

- **Filename:** `betterhelp_your-name_system-prompt.txt`
- **Format:** Plain text (.txt)
- **Length:** Max ~5,000 tokens (roughly 3–4K words)
<!-- col -->
<div class="callout">💡 **Tip:** You can use [OpenAI's Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to check the 'token count', but don't obsess over it.</div>
<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **📋 Suggested Sections for Your System Prompt:**

Use these headings (or something very close). Aim for **3–4 sections total**:

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->

- 3–10 things you'd still want to ask the client
- Capture confusion or contradictions you noticed
- These will feed into discussion in the next live session
<!-- /row -->
---
## 📂 Part One: Mine the Internal Docs

<!-- block -->

### **⏱️ Time estimate: ~60 minutes**

<!-- block -->

You'll receive a .zip folder of BetterHelp internal materials (e.g., briefs, reports, Slack threads, decks, guidelines, etc.). These are intentionally **messy and realistic**.

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### ⚠️ **Important Mindset:**

Your job is **not** to summarize everything.

Your job is to find **what matters for creative decisions and AI prompting**.</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🔍 How to Work:**

<!-- block -->

**1. Skim fast first**
- Get a rough sense of the business, product, and vibe.

**2. Scan with a creative lens**
- Ask yourself:
   - *"What would help me write better copy/design better visuals?"*
   - *"What would I want a model to know before I prompt it?"*

**3. Capture key points as you go**
- Drop short bullets into a rough notes doc
- Copy/paste important quotes and label them (e.g., "voice", "metrics", "audience")

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

<details>
<summary>📋 Things to Look For (use as prompts, not a checklist)</summary>

### Brand & Business
- What does BetterHelp actually sell? What problem is it solving?
- How does the company make money? (subscriptions, one-off sales, ads, etc.)
- What outcomes matter most (growth, retention, engagement, brand recognition)?

***

### Audience
- Who are they trying to reach? Age, life stage, context.
- Does the actual audience (in data or anecdotes) match the intended one?
- Any strong opinions on who the brand is *not* for?

***

### How the Org Works with Creative
- Who seems to brief or approve creative work?
- Are they more "ship fast and test" or "polish until perfect"?
- Any clues about tools and workflows (Figma, Premiere, dashboards, etc.)?

***

### Voice, Tone, and Rules
- Phrases that feel very "on brand" or "off brand"
- Hard constraints (legal, brand, compliance) you must respect
- Any repeated preferences (e.g., "keep it simple", "no jargon", "no fear-based messaging")

***

### Performance & Priorities
- How do they judge if creative is working? (clicks, signups, revenue, ROAS, etc.)
- Where can creative move the needle the most? (ad CTR, landing page conversion, upsell, etc.)
- Any obvious blind spots or missed opportunities you might help with?

</details>

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">💡 **Tip:** As you notice confusion or contradictions, write them down for your eventual "Open Questions" section.</div>
---
## 🌐 Part Two: Research the Real World

<!-- block -->

### **⏱️ Time estimate: ~45–60 minutes**

<!-- block -->

Now zoom out beyond internal docs. You're trying to answer:

### *"How does this product, audience, and category actually show up in the wild?"*

<!-- block -->

Use a mix of **web search**, **social/community platforms**, and **reviews**. You can use AI tools to help summarize, but you're still the editor.

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🅰️ Product & Category Scan**

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
Search broadly for the product/category. Look at:
- Landing pages
- Comparison posts
- Buying guides
<!-- col -->
**Note recurring patterns:**
- Benefits and claims
- Visual/aesthetic patterns
- Common objections and FAQs
<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🅱️ Social & Communities**

<!-- block -->

Dip into places where real people talk:

**Reddit** • **Forums** • **YouTube** • **TikTok** • **Instagram** • **Discords** • **Blog comments**

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **🔍 Look for:**

- Repeated pain points and frustrations
- Habits and behaviors around the product/need
- In-group language, jokes, clichés, and myths
- What feels aspirational vs. relatable</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🅲️ Reviews (High-Value Shortcut)**

<!-- block -->

Scan reviews on platforms like:

**Amazon** • **Trustpilot** • **App stores** • **Reddit megathreads** • **Category-specific sites**

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<div class="callout">### **🔍 Look for:**

- The **exact phrases** people use to describe problems and wins
- Features people love vs. what annoys them
- Unexpected use cases or audiences</div>
<!-- col -->
[Placeholder: illustration of review mining]
<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

<!-- block -->

<details>
<summary>💡 Tip: Use AI as a Research Accelerator</summary>

You can use AI tools to:
- Summarize patterns across many reviews or articles
- Compare BetterHelp to key competitors
- List common objections, desires, or aesthetic trends

**But:** You decide what's important. Don't just paste an AI summary into your prompt—translate it into your own words, for your own creative use.

## 🏗️ Final Step: Build Your System Prompt

<!-- block -->

### **⏱️ Time estimate: ~15 minutes**

<!-- block -->

Now turn your notes into a **clean, usable document**.

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **📋 Steps:**

<!-- block -->

**1️⃣ Set up your headings**

Use the suggested structure from the Deliverable section (3–4 sections).

<!-- block -->

**2️⃣ Fill in each section with tight, useful bullets and short paragraphs**

Prioritize details that would help you tomorrow if you had to:
- ✏️ Write a new ad
- 🎨 Design a new landing page
- 🤖 Prompt an AI to concept a campaign

**Prefer clear, concrete statements over jargon.**

<!-- block -->

**3️⃣ Add a small "Open Questions" list**

3–10 items is enough. These will feed into discussion in the next live session.

<!-- block -->

**4️⃣ Trim and polish**

- Remove repetition and fluff
- Make sure every line helps you make better creative or prompting decisions
- Check that you're under ~5,000 tokens if you want to be precise

<!-- block -->

**5️⃣ Save and submit**

Save as `betterhelp_your-name_system-prompt.txt` and submit via the form below.

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### 💡 **The Goal:**

If you've done this well, your system prompt should feel like a **portable brain for BetterHelp**—something you can attach to any future AI prompt or creative brief to instantly get into the right mindset.</div>

## ⭐ Recap

<!-- block -->

### **Key Takeaways from Session #5:**

- **📂 Internal docs are messy** – Your job isn't to summarize everything; it's to find what matters for creative decisions and AI prompting.

- **🌐 External research grounds the brand** – Web searches, communities, and reviews reveal how the product actually lives in the real world.

- **🧠 System prompts are portable brains** – A well-crafted system prompt lets you (and AI) instantly get into the right mindset for any BetterHelp task.

- **✍️ Synthesis > Summary** – The best system prompts are opinionated and actionable, not neutral or encyclopedic.

- **❓ Open questions are valuable** – Capturing what you don't know helps you ask better questions and makes discussions more productive.
