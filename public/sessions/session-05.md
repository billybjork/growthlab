### **📋 Objectives:**

- 🔍 Distill key insights from BetterHelp's internal docs for creative decision-making
- 🌐 Research the market and audience to understand real behaviors, needs, and positioning
- 🧠 Synthesize findings into a clear BetterHelp system prompt for consistent, brand-aligned creative and AI work
- 📄 Produce a portable "system prompt" document to be used for the rest of the course

<!-- block -->

<details>
<summary>📚 Pre-Work (required before starting)</summary>

Complete **[Assignment #4](session.html?file=session-04&card=assignment-4-reading-system-prompts)** from Session #4:
- Read through one of the [Leaked System Prompts](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts) and note what you found interesting or unexpected.
- This will help you understand what makes an effective system prompt before you build your own!

## 🎯 What You're Making

<!-- block -->

For the rest of the course, we'll focus on **BetterHelp** (not BarkBox).

In this session, you'll build a **BetterHelp System Prompt**: a compact reference you and your AI tools can reuse for any creative task in your capstone.

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<div class="callout">### **Your system prompt will capture:**

- 🏢 What BetterHelp is and how it works
- 👥 Who it's for and the world it lives in
- 🎨 How to create on-brand work that actually moves the business</div>

<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🛠️ How You'll Get There:**

You'll turn scattered information into one clear text file through **two main parts**:

1. **📂 Review internal docs** – Scan company materials and pull out what matters for creative work
2. **🌐 Research the real world** – Do focused external research (web, communities, reviews) to connect the brand to reality

Then you'll **assemble your BetterHelp System Prompt** from those insights.

## 📄 Deliverable: Your System Prompt

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
### **File specifications:**

- **Filename:** `betterhelp_your-name_system-prompt.txt`
- **Format:** Plain text (.txt)
- **Length:** Max ~5,000 tokens (roughly 3–4K words)
   - Use [OpenAI's Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to check the 'token count', but don't obsess over it.

<details>
<summary>🤔 What's a token?</summary>

Tokens are how AI models "read" text—small chunks that are usually a word or part of a word. Think of them as the AI's unit of measurement for text length.

**Quick math:** 1 token ≈ ¾ of a word (so 5,000 tokens ≈ 3,750 words).

**Why it matters:** Every AI conversation has a token budget. Your system prompt, your message, *and* the AI's response all share that space. A leaner system prompt leaves more room for the actual creative work.

## 📂 Part One: Mine the Internal Docs

<!-- block -->

### **⏱️ Time estimate: ~60 minutes**

<!-- block -->

<div style="text-align: center">#### 🗂️ [SOURCE DOCUMENTS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FPBZidlDkwf55jltrpaLmN4uPVCP6G8p/view?usp=sharing) (download link)</div>

<!-- block -->

Download the folder linked above, containing (imaginary) internal materials from BetterHelp (e.g., briefs, reports, Slack threads, decks, guidelines, etc.). These are intentionally **messy and realistic**.

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### ⚠️ **Important Mindset:**

Your job is **not** to summarize everything.

Your job is to find **what matters for creative decisions and AI prompting**.</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### **🔍 How to Work:**

<!-- block -->

**1. Skim fast first**
- Get a rough sense of the business, product, and vibe.

**2. Scan with a creative lens**
- Ask yourself:
   - *"What would help me write better copy/design better visuals?"*
   - *"What would I want a model to know before I prompt it?"*

**3. Capture key points as you go**
- Drop short bullets into a rough notes doc
- Copy/paste important quotes and label them (e.g., "voice", "metrics", "audience")

<!-- block -->

<details>
<summary>📋 Things to Look For (use as prompts, not a checklist)</summary>

### 🏢 Brand & Business
- What does BetterHelp actually sell? What problem is it solving?
- How does the company make money? (subscriptions, one-off sales, ads, etc.)
- What outcomes matter most (growth, retention, engagement, brand recognition)?

***

### 👥 Audience
- Who are they trying to reach? Age, life stage, context.
- Does the actual audience (in data or anecdotes) match the intended one?
- Any strong opinions on who the brand is *not* for?

***

### 🎨 How the Org Works with Creative
- Who seems to brief or approve creative work?
- Are they more "ship fast and test" or "polish until perfect"?
- Any clues about tools and workflows (Figma, Premiere, dashboards, etc.)?

***

### 🗣️ Voice, Tone, and Rules
- Phrases that feel very "on brand" or "off brand"
- Hard constraints (legal, brand, compliance) you must respect
- Any repeated preferences (e.g., "keep it simple", "no jargon", "no fear-based messaging")

***

### 📊 Performance & Priorities
- How do they judge if creative is working? (clicks, signups, revenue, ROAS, etc.)
- Where can creative move the needle the most? (ad CTR, landing page conversion, upsell, etc.)
- Any obvious blind spots or missed opportunities you might help with?

## 🌐 Part Two: Research the Real World

<!-- block -->

### **⏱️ Time estimate: ~30 minutes**

<!-- block -->

Now zoom out beyond internal docs. You're trying to answer:

<!-- block -->

<div style="text-align: center">### *"How does this product, audience, and category actually show up in the wild?"*</div>

<!-- block -->

<img src="media/session-05/20251204_103100.webp" alt="" style="display: block; max-width: 410px; width: 410px;;;;;;;;;;;; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

<!-- block -->

<div style="text-align: center">Use a mix of **web search**, **social/community platforms**, and **reviews**.

You can use AI tools to help summarize, but you're still the editor.</div>

### **🔍 Where to Look**

<!-- block -->

<!-- row -->
<img src="media/session-05/20251204_104210.webp" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
<!-- col -->
#### 🌐 Product & Category
- Landing pages, comparison posts, buying guides
- Note recurring benefits, claims, visuals, and FAQs

#### 💬 Social & Communities
- Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, forums, Discords
- Find pain points, habits, in-group language, aspirations

#### ✍🏻 Reviews
- Trustpilot, app stores, Reddit megathreads
- Capture exact phrases for problems and wins
<!-- /row -->

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### **🔎 What to Look For**

- Repeated pain points and frustrations
- Habits and behaviors around the product/need
- In-group language, jokes, clichés, and myths
- The **exact phrases** people use to describe problems and wins
- Unexpected use cases or audiences</div>

<!-- block -->

<details>
<summary>💡 Tip: Use AI to Accelerate Your Research</summary>

You can use AI tools to:
- Summarize patterns across many reviews or articles
- Compare BetterHelp to key competitors
- List common objections, desires, or aesthetic trends

**But:** You decide what's important. Don't just paste an AI summary into your prompt—translate it into your own words, for your own creative use.

## 🏗️ Final Step: Build Your System Prompt

<!-- block -->

### **⏱️ Time estimate: ~15-30 minutes**

<!-- block -->

<div style="text-align: center">#### Now, turn your notes into a **clean, usable document**.</div>

<!-- block -->

<img src="media/session-05/20251204_110258.webp" alt="" style="display: block; max-width: 363px; width: 363px;;;;;; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### 🪜 Steps:

1. **Set up headings** – Use the suggested structure (3–4 sections).

2. **Fill in each section** – Tight bullets and short paragraphs (clear, concrete statements > jargon).

3. **Trim and polish** – Remove fluff. Every line should help you make better creative or prompting decisions.

4. **Save and submit** – Save as `betterhelp_your-name_system-prompt.txt`, upload to Google Drive, then submit below.

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

<div class="callout">### 💡 **The Goal:**

If you've done this well, your system prompt should feel like a **portable 🧠 brain for BetterHelp** -- something you can attach to any future AI prompt or creative brief to instantly get into the right mindset.</div>

<!-- block -->

***

<!-- block -->

### 📥 Submit Your System Prompt

<div data-form="assignment-5">
