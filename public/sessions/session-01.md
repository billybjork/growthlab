### Welcome to GrowthLab! 🎉

[Visual idea: GrowthLab branding/logo animation or welcome graphic]

Today we'll cover:
- **Orientation** – about GrowthAssistant and this course
- **Exploration** – state-of-the-art AI applications
- **Foundation** – introducing our first brand and assignment

But first… a fun introduction game to get to know each other!

## Two Truths and a Lie

🎯 **Ice breaker activity**

**How it works:**
1. Everyone shares all three images simultaneously in the Slack channel
2. You'll have ~3 minutes to review all photos and vote on which one you think is real (using numbered emoji reactions)
3. Each person gets ~30 seconds to:
   - Briefly introduce themselves
   - Reveal which photo is real
   - Share any quick context about the photo

## Why GrowthLab Exists

### ⭐ The Shifting Landscape of Creative Work

**Today, anyone can make a design or video (in theory).**

Increasingly, your work will be compared against what non-creatives can create themselves – like your client or manager.

**As a result:**
- The value of tasks AI can do (or humans aided by AI) will **decrease** 📉
- The value of tasks AI cannot do (or require unique human input) will **increase** 📈

---

### 💭 So what differentiates you as a professional creative?

**This course will set out to answer this question.**

The answer is a combination of:
- ✨ **Exercising creative taste & judgment**
- 🎯 **Understanding your client's intent and objectives**
- 🚀 **Shepherding a concept from idea through execution**
- 🛠️ **Mastery of specialized tools**

> 💡 **Food for thought:** While AI drives down the value of skills it can do, it also drives up the value of skills it cannot do!

### 🏆 The "Holy Grail" Client Relationship

**What it feels like for the client:**
- ✅ Trust that you will apply creative judgment when interpreting briefs
- ✅ Seek clarity and provide suggestions as needed
- ✅ Comfortable communicating at a higher level – more focus on overarching intent & direction than specific implementation details
- ✅ Doesn't feel the urge to micro-manage or handhold

**What it feels like for you:**
- ✅ Messy, incomplete briefs aren't scary – you know how to fill gaps and ask for clarity when needed
- ✅ Reviews feel calm and smooth – you share the right fidelity at the right moment, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth
- ✅ You can explain why a concept works (or doesn't)
- ✅ You link choices to your knowledge of the audience, past learnings, and brand guidelines

## AI Frontier Exploration

### 🚀 Exploring What's Possible

The frontier of cutting-edge AI tools changes every day. The only way to keep up is to get in the habit of exploring what's out there.

**💭 Questions to ask yourself:**
- Does this feel fundamentally new or different than what exists already?
- What past developments/innovations does this build on?
- Where might it evolve from here?
- What could I do with this?

---

### 👥 Breakout Room Activity

**Setup:**
- Break into ~4-5 small groups
- Each group receives a collection of state-of-the-art AI examples for a specific category

**Categories include:**
- 🧠 Image generation models with "thinking" – Nano Banana Pro
- 🎥 Visual reasoning via video generation
- 🔄 Real-time angle changes on any axis
- 🌍 World models, gaussian splats (Genie 3, Marble)
- ✨ "Anything to anything" image/video edits
- 🎨 "Segment anything" to 3D

**🎯 Your Task:**

Spend ~5-10 minutes exploring and discussing your collection of AI examples.

Each group elects a representative to share learnings with the broader group.

---

### 📢 Group Presentations

Each representative takes ~3 minutes to "teach" everyone about their category of AI innovation:

- What makes it exciting / inspiring / scary
- What previous innovations/developments it might be building on
- Where it may go in the future
- How it could be applied to creative work

Billy fills in with additional context as needed.
