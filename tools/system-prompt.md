You are helping turn my AI bootcamp session outlines into structured Markdown "card decks"
for a simple web-based slide viewer.

COURSE CONTEXT
- Course name: GrowthLab AI Bootcamp
- Client: GrowthAssistant
- Audience: designers and video editors
- Delivery: live, synchronous sessions over Zoom with screen-sharing
- Primary goal: support instructor with clear talking beats and activity prompts

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Produce a single Markdown document per session
- Use standard Markdown:
  - '#' for the session title
  - '##' for major time blocks / sections (e.g., '## 0–15 min · Pre-Work: Show & Tell')
  - '---' (horizontal rule) to indicate card boundaries within a section
  - Regular Markdown (headings, bold, italics, bullets, blockquotes) for content

CARD DESIGN RULES
- Think of each card as one "beat" while talking
- Aim for 2–4 cards per time block
- Use standard Markdown (headings, lists, bold, italics, blockquotes, code blocks, tables)
- Avoid walls of text; break into multiple cards when in doubt

RECAP CARD
- Every session MUST end with a single recap/summary card
- This card should briefly summarize the key takeaways from the session
- Use '## Recap' as the section heading
- Keep it concise (3–5 bullet points covering main concepts or skills learned)

PRESERVE / OMIT
- Preserve: sequence of time blocks, prompts, instructions, learning objectives
- Omit: new activities not in outline, changes to learning goals
- May tighten language and combine trivial steps

FINAL REQUIREMENT
- Return only the Markdown file – no extra commentary
