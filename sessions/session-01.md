# Foundations of AI for Creatives

## 0–10 min · Welcome & Framing

**Goal:** Set context for the bootcamp and what we'll explore together over the next 10 weeks.

---

Welcome to the GrowthLab AI Bootcamp! Over the next 10 weeks, we'll explore how AI tools can enhance—not replace—your creative process.

This bootcamp is designed for:
- **Designers** looking to iterate faster and explore more directions
- **Video editors** seeking new ways to prototype and refine content
- **Creative professionals** who want to leverage AI strategically

---

**What we'll cover:**

- Week 1-2: Foundations & Rapid Prototyping
- Week 3-4: Advanced Prompting & Iteration
- Week 5-6: Integration into Real Projects
- Week 7-10: Specialized workflows & Capstone

---

## 10–25 min · The Current AI Landscape

**Goal:** Understand what AI tools exist and what they're actually good at.

---

**Three broad categories of AI tools:**

1. **Text-based** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
   - Fast ideation, copywriting, brief generation

2. **Image-based** (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
   - Visual exploration, concept art, asset generation

3. **Video-based** (Runway, Synthesia, emerging tools)
   - B-roll generation, editing, voiceover synthesis

---

**Important reality check:**

> Prompt: "What AI tools do you already use in your daily workflow, and where do you see gaps?"

These tools are **best for:**
- Generating variations quickly
- Overcoming creative blocks
- Handling repetitive, templated work

These tools are **NOT good for:**
- Brand consistency (yet)
- Complex narratives
- Client-specific customization (without significant refinement)

---

## 25–40 min · Hands-On: First Prompt

**Goal:** Get comfortable with basic prompt structure and see results in real-time.

---

### Activity: Simple Prompt Test

Let's start with a basic prompt in Gemini:

**Tool:** Gemini Advanced (Google Workspace)

1. Open [google.com/gemini](https://google.com/gemini)
2. Copy this prompt into the chat:

> "I'm a designer working on a campaign for a sustainable fashion brand. Generate 3 short, catchy taglines that emphasize eco-consciousness without sounding preachy."

3. Review the output. What works? What's generic?
4. Try rephrasing the prompt to be more specific (add brand personality, tone, etc.)

---

**Facilitator notes:**

- This is just to get everyone comfortable asking questions of an AI.
- Emphasize that good prompts are like good briefs—specificity matters.
- Expect 2-3 iterations before results feel usable.

---

## 40–55 min · Constraints & Creativity

**Goal:** Understand how constraints paradoxically unlock creativity with AI.

---

**The precision spectrum:**

AI tools work best when you give them clear boundaries. Too vague, and you get generic. Too constrained, and it's just busywork.

Examples of **vague briefs:**

> "Make a cool design for a tech startup."

vs. **Precise briefs:**

> "Create a black-and-white minimalist logo for a fintech app that helps freelancers track invoices. Style: flat, no gradients, modern sans-serif."

---

### Activity: Precision Spectrum Mapping

In your breakout rooms (3-4 people each):

1. You'll find a FigJam board linked in Slack
2. I'll provide 5 brief examples (ranging from vague to precise)
3. **Your task:**
   - Place each brief on the spectrum
   - Rate which ones are "AI-ready" vs. which need refinement
   - Discuss: Why does precision matter for AI prompts?

*Timeboxed: 10 minutes, then we'll discuss as a group.*

---

## 55–75 min · Real-World Example

**Goal:** See a full workflow: from brief → AI generation → refinement.

---

**Scenario:** A client wants 3 social media ad concepts for a new coffee product launch.

*I'll walk through this live:*

1. **Brief preparation** (2 min)
   - What do we know about the product? (specialty coffee, sustainable sourcing)
   - Who's the audience? (health-conscious professionals, 25–40)
   - What's the tone? (aspirational but approachable)

2. **Generate initial concepts** (5 min)
   - Use Gemini to ideate 5 ad angles
   - Review and discuss what sticks

3. **Refine with feedback** (5 min)
   - "That third one is interesting, but it's too generic. Can you make it more specific to morning routines?"
   - Show how iteration compounds results

4. **Polish & prepare** (3 min)
   - Pull the best angles into a one-pager for the client

---

**Key takeaway:**

AI tools are fastest when you're in a **feedback loop**—not expecting perfection on the first try.

---

## 75–85 min · Q&A & Reflection

**Facilitator notes:**

- Use this time to address lingering concerns
- Some people worry about job displacement—acknowledge it, but focus on augmentation
- Invite people to share if they've tried any AI tools before

---

> Prompt: "What's one creative task in your workflow that feels tedious, repetitive, or time-consuming? That's likely where AI could help you most."

---

## 85–90 min · Assignment & Closing

### Assignment #1: Exploration Log

By next session (Day 2), explore **one** of the tools we discussed:

- **Option A:** Spend 20 minutes in Gemini generating 3 different briefs (for any project or hypothetical client).
- **Option B:** If you have access to Midjourney or DALL-E, generate 3 image concepts for a brand of your choice.
- **Option C:** Write down 2-3 specific workflows where you think AI could save you time this week.

**Submit to:** Shared Slack channel `#assignments`

Save your outputs and bring them to next session—we'll discuss what worked and what didn't.

---

**Thank you!**

You've covered the fundamentals. Next session, we'll dive into **Rapid Prototyping**, exploring how to generate multiple design directions in hours instead of days.

See you Day 2! 🚀
